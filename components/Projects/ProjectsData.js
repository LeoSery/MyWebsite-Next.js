    Description: "This game is a student project representing a 20-minute slice concept of a game made to validate a master's degree in game development. Poladroid is a TPS-camera traversal/stealth game in which the player takes on the role of a small robot. The action takes place in a near-future, dystopian Futurism, in a world seeking to break away from its roots. The character is one of the last of his kind, embodying the old world, but rejected and hunted. The action takes place in a factory-like building, and the aim of the game is to escape without being caught by the various robot guards/workers.",
